Things you should do in computer land

## When you have a little bit of time on your hands, try knocking off some of these tasks

Step 1
======

* [Get a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
  - if your brother has a github account, let me know!
* [Get GitHub for desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* Figure out how to fork this repo :smirk:
  - add a line to this README using your choice of IDE. [I recommend VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - commit this line to your "fork" of this repo & "push your changes" to github
* Submit a ["pull request"](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to this repo

Step 2
======

* [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* [Install python](https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/77da993b14a48753efda#install-python)
  - Mac OS ships with a crappier old version of python
  - Homebrew allows you to install `python2` and `python3` on the same computer without conflict
* Get your leap year code working locally
* Commit your code and push - then submit another pull request to this repo :smile:
